    ... and my new Astro site!
  </h2>
  <p>
    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
    on my website and I'm building it myself.
  </p>
  <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial.</p>
  <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My name is {identity.firstName}</li>
    <li>
      I live in {identity.country} and I work as a {identity.occupation}
    </li>
    {
      identity.hobbies.length > 2 && (
        <li>
          My hobbies include {identity.hobbies.slice(0, -1).join(", ")}, and{" "}
          {identity.hobbies.slice(-1)}
        </li>
      )
    }
  </ul>
  <p>My skills are:</p>
  <ul>
    {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
  </ul>
  {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}
  {
    finished ? (
      <p>I have finished the tutorial!</p>
    ) : (
      <p>I have {goal} more days to finish.</p>
    )
  }
